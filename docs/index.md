# Intro

Hello, 

this is a minimal {[bookdown](https://bookdown.org/)} diary-style notebook to document this project.

The documentation of this project is broken down into several chunks:

- [1 Intro](./index.html): General intro to the project (you are looking at this right now...)
- [2 Project development](./project-development.html): Here I keep a diary of the development of the project.
- [3 Notes](./project-notes.html): Notes on meetings, ideas, what should be or has been read, etc.
- [4 Data](./data.html): The data needed and compiled for the project.
- [5 Analysis](./analysis.html): The analysis. (We might want to break this into several subsections)
- [6 References](./references.html): This is where session infor and all cited sources of your project will be listed.

## Dependencies

To be able to use this in your own projects you will need to `R` as well as the {bookdown} package installed:

```r
install.packages("bookdown")
```
