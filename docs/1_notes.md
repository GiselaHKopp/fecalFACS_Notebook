# Project notes



Here I collect meeting notes, ideas and papers read or must read.

## Meeting notes
**17.06.2021 Kick-off meeting**  
*Gisela, Dina, Urs, Camilla*  

* General discussion of plan and time schedule  
* Dina suggests to use the *Phyllostomus discolor* individuals that Camila is using for experiments in the barn (06-07/2021) for sample collections. They would also give the opportunity to assess the influence of different diets (frugivorous vs. mealworms) 
* Gisela reports on alternative storage solution to RNAlater, DNA/RNA Shield (ZymoResearch), which has the advantage of being desinfectant and might therefore simplify sample import. She suggests to collect samples in both solutions to investigate if storage solution affects analysis results. 
* Schedule one meeting/months to catch up on project progress and updates  
* **To Do**  
  &check; ~~Gisela: Order sample collection material~~     
    &check; ~~storage solutions RNAlater & DNA/RNAshield~~  
    &check; ~~falcon tubes~~  
    &check; ~~what else??? spatulas!~~
  &check; ~~Gisela: Sample collection material to Camilla for Phyl. in barn~~  
  + Urs: organize Kibale sample collection  
  &check; ~~Gisela: Hire Melina as HiWi~~  
  &check; ~~Gisela: create shared project folder on ownCloud~~  
  &check; ~~Gisela & Dina: Meet with Javier to discuss spanish field work~~  
  + Gisela: &check; ~~contact FlowKon again to specifiy project plan~~  
    - staining protocol  
    - order dyes  
    - schedule first test runs  
  &check; ~~Gisela: contact Affenberg again to inquire state of sample collection~~  
  &check; ~~Gisela: take *N. noctula* samples to Uni~~   
  
**18.06.2021 Spanish field work meeting**  
*Gisela, Javier*  

* General introduction to project  
* Field work in July    
* Sampling of 20 individuals possible  
* **To Do**   
  &check; ~~Gisela: send sample collection protocol to Javier~~  
  &check; ~~Gisela: send sample collection material to Javier~~  

**24.06.2021 Kibale sample collection planning**  
*Urs, Gisela*  

* sample 20 individuals, and store 2 replicate samples: 1 in RNAlater and 1 in DNA/RNAshield (study group in total: 40-50 adults)
* material to send to Kibale: at least 40 falcon tubes, 100ml RNAlater, 180ml DNA/RNAshield, tube labels, sample boxes, gloves size M, spatulas  
* **To Do**  
	&check; ~~Gisela: compile & prepare material~~    
	&check; ~~Gisela: finalize sample collection data sheet & protocol~~
	+ Urs: organize shipment
	+ Urs: payment contracts or invoice for field assistant collection work
 

**22.07.2021 FlowKON planning**  
*Gisela, Melina, Annette*  

* Samples need to be decontaminated to prevent infection risk (which is increased because of high aerosol production during sorting)  
* available samples so far:  
  + Barbary macaques (*Macaca sylvanus*), semi-freeranging, Affenberg Salem, stored in RNAlater or Ethanol  
  + Common noctule (*Nyctalus noctula*), freeranging, Konstanz/Kreuzlingen, stored in RNAlater;
  + Pale spear-nosed bat (*Phyllostomus discolor*), captive, stored in RNAlater oder DNA/RNA shield  
* according to manufacturer, DNA/RNA shield "inactivates infectious agents (viral, bacterial, fungal andparasitic)"  
* 70% Ethanol probably efficient for inactivation  

* Depending on storage solution, samples need to be transfered to other buffer, staining is conducted in in PBS-based buffer, samples need to be free of ethanol for sorting  
* storage solution probably affects sorting analyses  
* need to make sure, that storage solution is compatible with staining method  

* include isotype control with same fluorochrome

* **time schedule:**  
  + in total aim is to analyse approx 100 samples  
  + Potentially sorting of 3 samples/day (will become evident after establishment of sorting)  
  + Annette on vacation End of August/beginning of September  
  + new TA for cell sorting (probably) starts mid september, i.e. this is when we can start with sorting  
  + July/August: verify storage solutions and effects, order staining material, test staining and sorting
  
* **To Do**  
	&check; ~~Gisela: send DNA RNA shield data sheets to Annette~~   
* Gisela: contact safety officer (Kunze) to get offical classification of safety level for samples  
* Gisela: check ethanol concentration of Affenberg samples  
* Gisela: email Michael Mende for lab introduction  
* Gisela: order staining material
