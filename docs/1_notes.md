# Project notes



Here I collect meeting notes, ideas and papers read or must read.

## Meeting notes
**17.06.2021 Kick-off meeting**  
*Gisela, Dina, Urs, Camilla*  

* General discussion of plan and time schedule  
* Dina suggests to use the *Phyllostomus discolor* individuals that Camila is using for experiments in the barn (06-07/2021) for sample collections. They would also give the opportunity to assess the influence of different diets (frugivorous vs. mealworms) 
* Gisela reports on alternative storage solution to RNAlater, DNA/RNA Shield (ZymoResearch), which has the advantage of being desinfectant and might therefore simplify sample import. She suggests to collect samples in both solutions to investigate if storage solution affects analysis results. 
* Schedule one meeting/months to catch up on project progress and updates  
* **To Do**  
  &check; ~~Gisela: Order sample collection material~~     
    &check; ~~storage solutions RNAlater & DNA/RNAshield~~

  &check; ~~Gisela: create shared project folder on ownCloud~~  
  &check; ~~Gisela & Dina: Meet with Javier to discuss spanish field work~~  
  + Gisela: &check; ~~contact FlowKon again to specifiy project plan~~  
    - staining protocol  
    - order dyes  
    - schedule first test runs  
  &check; ~~Gisela: contact Affenberg again to inquire state of sample collection~~  
  &check; ~~Gisela: take *N. noctula* samples to Uni~~   
  
**18.06.2021 Spanish field work meeting**  
*Gisela, Javier*  

* General introduction to project  
* Field work in July    
* Sampling of 20 individuals possible  
* **To Do**   
  &check; ~~Gisela: send sample collection protocol to Javier~~  
  &check; ~~Gisela: send sample collection material to Javier~~  

**24.06.2021 Kibale sample collection planning**  
*Urs, Gisela*  

* sample 20 individuals, and store 2 replicate samples: 1 in RNAlater and 1 in DNA/RNAshield (study group in total: 40-50 adults)
* material to send to Kibale: at least 40 falcon tubes, 100ml RNAlater, 180ml DNA/RNAshield, tube labels, sample boxes, gloves size M, spatulas  
* **To Do**  
	&check; ~~Gisela: compile & prepare material~~    
	&check; ~~Gisela: finalize sample collection data sheet & protocol~~
	+ Urs: organize shipment
	+ Urs: payment contracts or invoice for field assistant collection work
 

**22.07.2021 FlowKON planning**  
*Gisela, Melina, Annette*  

* Samples need to be decontaminated to prevent infection risk (which is increased because of high aerosol production during sorting)  
* available samples so far:  
  + Barbary macaques (*Macaca sylvanus*), semi-freeranging, Affenberg Salem, stored in RNAlater or Ethanol  
  + Common noctule (*Nyctalus noctula*), freeranging, Konstanz/Kreuzlingen, stored in RNAlater;
  + Pale spear-nosed bat (*Phyllostomus discolor*), captive, stored in RNAlater oder DNA/RNA shield  
* according to manufacturer, DNA/RNA shield "inactivates infectious agents (viral, bacterial, fungal andparasitic)"  
* 70% Ethanol probably efficient for inactivation  

* Depending on storage solution, samples need to be transfered to other buffer, staining is conducted in in PBS-based buffer, samples need to be free of ethanol for sorting  
* storage solution probably affects sorting analyses  
* need to make sure, that storage solution is compatible with staining method  

* include isotype control with same fluorochrome

* **time schedule:**  
  + in total aim is to analyse approx 100 samples  
  + Potentially sorting of 3 samples/day (will become evident after establishment of sorting)  
  + Annette on vacation End of August/beginning of September  
  + new TA for cell sorting (probably) starts mid september, i.e. this is when we can start with sorting  
  + July/August: verify storage solutions and effects, order staining material, test staining and sorting
  
* **To Do**  
	&check; ~~Gisela: send DNA RNA shield data sheets to Annette~~   
* Gisela: contact safety officer (Kunze) to get offical classification of safety level for samples  
* Gisela: check ethanol concentration of Affenberg samples  
* Gisela: email Michael Mende for lab introduction  
* Gisela: order staining material

**30.08.2021 - update**  
*Gisela, Melina*
* still many orders missing

**14.12.2021 - update**  
*Melina*
*  4 test samples were processed in Munich with Lisa Richter. Result: When using Alexa Flour 488 staining, permeabilization of the samples is required prior to staining. Nevertheless, hardly any cells could be sorted and accordingly little DNA could be extracted. 
Possible causes:  
1. samples stored too long
2. wrong stain
3. too little fecal material
4. loss of cells during the first purification steps --> leave out centrifugation in the first step?

*Melina*
* 4 test samples were processed in Munich with Lisa Richter. Hardly any cells could be sorted and accordingly little DNA could be extracted.

**17.02.2022 - update**  
*Melina*
* 5 test samples were processed in Munich with Lisa Richter. Hardly any cells could be sorted and accordingly little DNA could be extracted.

Possible causes:  
1. samples stored too long
2. wrong stain
3.Samples take too long during shipping to Munich. 
    
**04.04.2022 - update**  
*Annette, Gisela, Melina*
* Discussion with Annette Sommershof about the possible processing of the Affenberg samples in Konstanz. Annette suspects that the samples have been stored too long and therefore the staining does not work well.

**04.04.2022 - update**  
*Roland, Gisela, Melina*
* Roland collects new samples to test if the samples have been stored too long. 

**30.05.2022 - trouble shooting discussion**  
*Gisela, Melina, Amanda Melin, Riya Mathur*
* Melina reports on the state of the project and that the sorting so far has not provided the expected yield.  
* Amanda highlights that the protocol is very time sensitive: as soon as the sample is taken out of RNAlater, all steps need to be completed as soon as possible. 
* Amanda suggests to invite her lab manager Gwen Duytschaever to visit to help with optimizing the lab work. There is also an updated version of the protocol that would be helpful.    
* Melina will contact Gwen via email to ask for more recommendations.   
* Melina and Riya will run the new Barbary macaque samples on  June 1st and will now change the planning to complete everything from staining to DNA extraction within one day.  

**30.05.2022 - information and recommendations from Gwen**  
*Gwen*  
* Gwen provides protocols:  
	+ recipe for DAPI stain *RECIPE 005 - DAPI staining buffer.docx*, We use this product: https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/D1306?SKULINK #D1306, This is the manual: https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/mp01306.pdf
	+ cell sorting protocol *SOP #II.09 PME Protocol for Flow cytomety-JOE_rev06_GD.docx*,  We are also using a BD FACSAria so hopefully it will be easy to set it up with the same sorting parameters. The sample prep takes between 3-4 hours (depending on the sample) and I typically sort 2 to 3 samples at a time.
	+ DNA extraction protocol *SOP #II.14 PME Protocol Qiagen DNA mini kit with Small Volumes of Blood_GD.docx*.  
	+ cytometer configuration settings. *130um nozzle 4 lasers configuration.csv*, *MELIN-GWEN-2C-ND-26OCT2021.pdf*. We’ve been using neutral density filter 2.0 and a large 130um nozzle. The data I shared are from a run where we got 2593 cells for sample 707 and 454 cells for sample 712.  
* Gwen suggests to use a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) for quantification of host DNA. We can also use qPCR but ddPCR is a bit more sensitive and can deal better with inhibitor prone samples. I am sharing the mammalian MYCBP primers we’ve been using for quantifying the host DNA below (doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-20427-9).
	+ (update Gisela: we can use a ddPCR system in Lutz Becks' lab, contact Ana del Caro ana.del-arco@uni-konstanz.de; details in del Arco et al. 2022)  
	+ Forward primer cmycF GCCAGAGGAGGAACGAGCT  
	+ Reverse primer cmycR GGGCCTTTTCATTGTTTTCCA  
	+ #1864008 DG8 Cartridges, QX100/QX200, 24/PK   
	+ #1863009 DG8 Gaskets, QX100/QX200, 24/PK  
	+ #12001925 ddPCR Plates 96-Well,Semi-Skirted,25/BX  
	+ #1814040 PCR Plate Heat Seal, foil, pierceable  
	+ #1864006 QX200 DG Oil for EvaGreen, 10 x 7 ml, 70 ml (10 x 7 ml), oil for use with the droplet generator in the QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System
	+ #1864034 ddPCR™ EvaGreen Supermix 500 x 20 ul reactions, 5 ml (5 x 1 ml), 2x supermix  
*  quantify the bacterial fraction in the samples as well (to test the success of the sorting)? I am sharing the primers we’ve been using below in case you would also like to order those.
