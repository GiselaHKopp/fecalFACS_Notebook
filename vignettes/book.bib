              paper can be used to support general biological principles of
              social evolution are briefly discussed. Two principles are
              presented, the first concerning the evolution of social behaviour
              in general and the second the evolution of social discrimination.
              Some tentative evidence is given. More general application of the
              theory in biology is then discussed, particular attention being
              given to cases where the indicated interpretation differs from
              previous views and to cases which appear anomalous. A hypothesis
              is outlined concerning social evolution in the Hymenoptera; but
              the evidence that at present exists is found somewhat contrary on
              certain points. Other subjects considered include warning
              behaviour, the evolution of distasteful properties in insects,
              clones of cells and clones of zooids as contrasted with other

  abstract  = "In 1964, W. D. Hamilton proposed a novel solution to the
               long-standing evolutionary puzzle: why do individuals cooperate?
               Hamilton predicted that, if individuals possess the ability to
               discriminate on the basis of kinship, then they should gain
               inclusive fitness benefits by biasing helpful behaviour towards
               relatives and harmful behaviour away from them. The possibility
               that kin selection might favour social evolution has now
               inspired five decades of active research. Here, I synthesize
               this evidence for social mammals. First, I report on the
               methodological advances that allow for pedigree construction,
               and re- view the evidence for maternal and paternal kin
               discrimination. Second, I recognize that a substantial body of
               evidence for the evolution of cooperative breeding via kin
               selection exists, and then focus on the potential for kin
               selection to favour less well understood, yet equally salient,
               targets of selection: social partner choice, coalition formation
               and social tolerance (withholding aggression). I find that kin
               selection favours remarkably similar patterns of nepotism in
               primate and nonprimates with respect to these short- lived
               social acts. Although social alliances among maternal and
               paternal kin are common in mammalian societies, kinship largely
               fails to protect individuals from aggression. Thus, an
               individual's closest asso- ciates and allies, many of whom are
               kin, are most often an individual's closest competitors within
               mammalian social groups. Taken together, these findings
               highlight the value of Hamilton's holistic approach in
               simultaneously considering the direct benefits of competition
               and the indirect fitness benefits of cooperation. Despite major
               empirical advances since the inception of kin selection theory,
               future tests using newly available molecular and statistical
               methods in combination with longitudinal behavioural data are
               required to partition the relative contributions of direct and
               indirect fitness on the lifetime inclusive fitness. Such
               approaches will elucidate the relative influences of
               evolutionary and ecological forces favouring social evolution
               across the mammalian lineage of social mammals.",

              studying the effects of genetic variation on collective behavior
              because their societies are defined by social interactions. To
              explore how the genetic composition of groups affects collective

              colonies, and we assayed the exploration and aggression of the

              specific genotypic combination of group members, i.e. we found
              evidence for genotype-by-genotype epistasis for both collective

              genome-wide information were mainly focused on comparisons
              between populations. Applications which infer the degree of
              relationship based on modern-day DNA information typically
              require diploid genotype data. Low concentration of endogenous
              DNA, fragmentation and other post-mortem damage to ancient DNA
              (aDNA) makes the application of such tools unfeasible for most
              archaeological samples. To infer family relationships for
              degraded samples, we developed the software READ (Relationship
              Estimation from Ancient DNA). We show that our heuristic approach
              can successfully infer up to second degree relationships with as
              little as 0.1x shotgun coverage per genome for pairs of
              individuals. We uncover previously unknown relationships among
              prehistoric individuals by applying READ to published aDNA data
              from several human remains excavated from different cultural
              contexts. In particular, we find a group of five closely related
              males from the same Corded Ware culture site in modern-day
              Germany, suggesting patrilocality, which highlights the
              possibility to uncover social structures of ancient populations
              by applying READ to genome-wide aDNA data. READ is publicly

              ninety-nine years after his death, a state funeral was offered to
              his living family to honor his role in the struggle for Irish
              independence. However, inaccuracies in record keeping did not
              allow the bodily remains that supposedly belonged to Kent to be
              identified with absolute certainty. Using a novel approach based
              on homozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms, we identified
              these remains to be those of Kent by comparing his genetic data
              to that of two known living relatives. As the DNA degradation
              found on Kent's DNA, characteristic of ancient DNA, rendered

              endogenous DNA, with the majority of sequencing capacity taken up
              by environmental DNA. Here we present a capture-based method for
              enriching the endogenous component of aDNA sequencing libraries.
              By using biotinylated RNA baits transcribed from genomic DNA
              libraries, we are able to capture DNA fragments from across the
              human genome.We demonstrate this method on libraries created from
              four Iron Age and Bronze Age human teeth from Bulgaria, as well
              as bone samples from seven Peruvian mummies and a Bronze Age hair
              sample from Denmark. Prior to capture, shotgun sequencing of
              these libraries yielded an average of 1.2\% of reads mapping to
              the human genome (including duplicates). After capture, this
              fraction increased substantially, with up to 59\% of reads mapped
              to human and enrichment ranging from 6- to 159-fold. Further-
              more, we maintained coverage of the majority of regions sequenced
              in the precapture library. Intersection with the 1000 Genomes
              Project reference panel yielded an average of 50,723 SNPs (range
              3,062--147,243) for the postcapture libraries sequenced with 1
              million reads, compared with 13,280 SNPs (range 217--73,266) for
              the precapture libraries, increasing resolution in population

  abstract = "Altruism poses a problemfor evolutionary biologists because
              natural selection is not expected to favor behaviors that are
              beneficial to recipients, but costly to actors. The theory of kin
              selection, first articulated by Hamilton (1964), pro- vides a
              solution to the problem. Hamilton's well-known rule (br>c)
              provides a simple algorithm for the evolution of altruism via kin
              selection. Because kin recognition is a crucial requirement of
              kin selection, it is important to know whether and how primates
              can recognize their relatives. While conventional wisdom has been
              that primates can recognize maternal kin, but not paternal kin,
              this view is being challenged by new findings. The ability to
              recognize kin implies that kin selection may shape altruistic
              behavior in primate groups. I focus on two cases in which kin
              selection is tightly woven into the fabric of social life. For
              female baboons, macaques, and vervets maternal kinship is an
              important axis of social networks, coalitionary activity, and
              dominance relationships. Detailed studies of the patterning of
              altruistic interactions within these species illustrate the
              extent and limits of nepotism in their social lives. Carefully
              integrated analyses of behavior, demography, and genetics among
              red howlers provide an independent example of how kin selection
              shapes social organization and behavior. In red howlers, kin
              bonds shape the life his- tories and reproductive performance of
              both males and female. The two cases demonstrate that kin
              selection can be a powerful source of altruistic activity within
              primate groups. However, to fully assess the role of kin
              selection in primate groups, we need more information about the
              effects of kinship on the patterning of behavior across the
              Primates and accurate information about paternal kin

               It offers novel ways to study and quantify animal behaviour

               specific analyses. We outline the types of behavioural data and
               questions that may be suitable to study using multilayer network
               analysis. We detail several multilayer methods, which can
