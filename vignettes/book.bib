  author   = "Hamilton, W D",
  abstract = "Grounds for thinking that the model described in the previous
              paper can be used to support general biological principles of
              social evolution are briefly discussed. Two principles are
              presented, the first concerning the evolution of social behaviour
              in general and the second the evolution of social discrimination.
              Some tentative evidence is given. More general application of the
              theory in biology is then discussed, particular attention being
              given to cases where the indicated interpretation differs from
              previous views and to cases which appear anomalous. A hypothesis
              is outlined concerning social evolution in the Hymenoptera; but
              the evidence that at present exists is found somewhat contrary on
              certain points. Other subjects considered include warning
              behaviour, the evolution of distasteful properties in insects,
              clones of cells and clones of zooids as contrasted with other
              types of colonies, the confinement of parental care to true
              offspring in birds and insects, fights, the behaviour of
              parasitoid insect larvae within a host, parental care in
              connection with monogyny and monandry and multi-ovulate ovaries
              in plants in connection with wind and insect pollination.",

@ARTICLE{Smith2014-dk,
  title     = "Hamilton's legacy: kinship, cooperation and social tolerance in
               mammalian groups",
  author    = "Smith, Jennifer E",
  abstract  = "In 1964, W. D. Hamilton proposed a novel solution to the
               long-standing evolutionary puzzle: why do individuals cooperate?
               Hamilton predicted that, if individuals possess the ability to
               discriminate on the basis of kinship, then they should gain
               inclusive fitness benefits by biasing helpful behaviour towards
               relatives and harmful behaviour away from them. The possibility
               that kin selection might favour social evolution has now
               inspired five decades of active research. Here, I synthesize
               this evidence for social mammals. First, I report on the
               methodological advances that allow for pedigree construction,
               and re- view the evidence for maternal and paternal kin
               discrimination. Second, I recognize that a substantial body of
               evidence for the evolution of cooperative breeding via kin
               selection exists, and then focus on the potential for kin
               selection to favour less well understood, yet equally salient,
               targets of selection: social partner choice, coalition formation
               and social tolerance (withholding aggression). I find that kin
               selection favours remarkably similar patterns of nepotism in
               primate and nonprimates with respect to these short- lived
               social acts. Although social alliances among maternal and
               paternal kin are common in mammalian societies, kinship largely
               fails to protect individuals from aggression. Thus, an
               individual's closest asso- ciates and allies, many of whom are
               kin, are most often an individual's closest competitors within
               mammalian social groups. Taken together, these findings
               highlight the value of Hamilton's holistic approach in
               simultaneously considering the direct benefits of competition
               and the indirect fitness benefits of cooperation. Despite major
               empirical advances since the inception of kin selection theory,
               future tests using newly available molecular and statistical
               methods in combination with longitudinal behavioural data are
               required to partition the relative contributions of direct and
               indirect fitness on the lifetime inclusive fitness. Such
               approaches will elucidate the relative influences of
               evolutionary and ecological forces favouring social evolution
               across the mammalian lineage of social mammals.",
