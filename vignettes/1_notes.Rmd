Here I collect meeting notes, ideas and papers read or must read.

## Meeting notes
**17.06.2021 Kick-off meeting**  
*Gisela, Dina, Urs, Camilla*  

* General discussion of plan and time schedule  
* Dina suggests to use the *Phyl.* individuals that Camila is using for experiments in the barn (06-07/2021) for sample collections. They would also give the opportunity to assess the influence of different diets (frugivorous vs. mealworms) 
* Gisela reports on alternative storage solution to RNAlater, DNA/RNA Shield (ZymoResearch), which has the advantage of being desinfectant and might therefore simplify sample import. She suggests to collect samples in both solutions to investigate if storage solution affects analysis results. 
* Schedule one meeting/months to catch up on project progress and updates
